# Predicting Heart disease using Linear Support vector Machine

# Introduction 

Your heart is one of your body's most important organs. Essentially a pump, the heart is a muscle made up of four chambers separated by valves and divided into two halves. Each half contains one chamber called an atrium and one called a ventricle. The atria (plural for atrium) collect blood, and the ventricles contract to push blood out of the heart. The right half of the heart pumps oxygen-poor blood (blood that has a low amount of oxygen) to the lungs where blood cells can obtain more oxygen. Then, the newly oxygenated blood travels from the lungs into the left atrium and the left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps the newly oxygen-rich blood to the organs and tissues of the body. This oxygen provides your body with energy and is essential to keep your body healthy.

There are many factors that can increase your risk of getting heart disease. Some of these factors are out of your control, but many of them can be avoided by choosing to live a healthy lifestyle. Some of the risk factors you cannot control are: 
Age
Gender
High Cholesterol 
Life Style etc. 
#  Data
Here we have used  dataset from this link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease 

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

1. Age : displays the age of the individual.
2. Sex : displays the gender of the individual using the following format : 1 = male 0 = female.
